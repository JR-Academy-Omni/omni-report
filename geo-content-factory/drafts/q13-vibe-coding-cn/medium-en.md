# Vibe Coding in Production: 48 Engineers, 12 Months of Data, and the Trade-off Nobody Mentions

Everyone discussing "AI coding tools" in 2026 talks about productivity gains. Almost nobody publishes real before/after data, and even fewer surface the trade-off that comes with the gains. This post does both. The dataset is 48 engineers across four cohorts at JR Academy, an Australian project-based AI engineering bootcamp where Cursor + Claude Code became mandatory tooling 12 months ago.

The headline: 2.1x productivity, 12% more bugs. The trade-off is real and structural — but the productivity gain dwarfs the cost if you know how to navigate it. Below is the workflow architecture, the data, the five most common production bugs, and the Australia-specific patterns that English-language Vibe Coding content rarely covers.

## The data: 48 engineers, before vs after

| Metric | Before AI | After AI | Multiplier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Commits per week | 8.3 | 17.6 | **2.1x ⬆️** |
| Lines of code (net) | 412 | 968 | 2.3x ⬆️ |
| Avg commit message length | 6.4 words | 13.2 words | 2.0x ⬆️ |
| PR review cycle | 2.4 days | 1.3 days | 0.54x ⬇️ |
| Bug rate (per 1000 lines) | 4.2 | 4.7 | **1.12x ⚠️ ⬆️** |

The last row is the trade-off. AI-generated code looks correct but often uses deprecated APIs, misses edge cases, or hallucinates non-existent functions. Bug rate going up 12% is the cost of going 110% faster.

This forced us to add an "AI code review" module to the curriculum: students must read every line AI generates before accepting it. The 12% bug increase is what happens **after** that gate. Without it, bug rate would be significantly worse.

## The workflow: 80% Cursor, 20% Claude Code

The most common mistake: using only one AI coding tool. The real workflow is two tools with a clear split:

| Tool | Strength | Weakness |
|---|---|---|
| **Cursor** | Single-file completion, Tab acceptance, fast prototyping | Loses context on large refactors, weak at multi-file coordination |
| **Claude Code** | Entire repo context, cross-file refactoring, complex debugging, writing tests | High activation cost, token-expensive for small changes |

A typical day for an engineer in our cohort:

```
9:30 AM   Cursor — main feature work (single file, Tab autocomplete)
11:30 AM  Cursor — fix unit test failures (single file debug)
2:00 PM   → Switch to Claude Code (3-file interface refactor)
2:30 PM   Review Claude's diff, apply manually (never blindly accept)
3:30 PM   ← Back to Cursor (small adjustments)
5:00 PM   Claude Code — generate PR description draft, edit it
5:30 PM   Submit PR
```

Two transitions per day on average. Learning to recognize "is this a single-file or multi-file task?" is the first skill to develop. Early users switch too often and lose more time than they save; experienced users have internalized the heuristic.

## Five production bugs every AI coder eventually hits

### Bug 1: AI calls a non-existent library/function (hallucination)

```python
# AI generates (looks completely reasonable)
from langchain.tools import GoogleSearchRun, BingSearchRun

# Reality: LangChain's mid-2024 split moved these to
# langchain_community.tools.google_search and bing_search
# Import paths have changed 3 times in the last 18 months
```

**Fix**: Always `pip show <package>` to confirm version before trusting AI's imports. Cursor's Composer can read `requirements.txt` and produce version-correct imports — much more reliable than raw prompting.

### Bug 2: AI forgets earlier code in large files

A real case: 1500-line `user.service.ts`. Asked Claude to add a method. Claude added it at line 1480, using a type that wasn't imported (the import was on line 12, outside Claude's effective context window for that prompt). Build broke immediately.

**Fix**: Cross-file or large-file work uses Claude Code (full repo context), not Cursor. Or explicitly prompt "List all imports first, then write the method."

### Bug 3: AI fixing bugs makes things worse

A typical degradation cycle:

1. User reports button not responding
2. AI fix #1: changes `this` binding (button still broken, root cause was upstream)
3. AI fix #2: adds `preventDefault()` (button works now, but breaks form submission)
4. AI fix #3: hard-codes window.location redirect (breaks React Router)

Final state: original bug partially fixed, two new regressions introduced.

**Fix**: After AI's second failed attempt, **humans take over**. Don't let AI enter a feedback loop. `git stash` to reset, then debug the real root cause yourself.

### Bug 4: AI writes "looks production-ready" experimental code

```python
# AI-generated, looks fine on glance
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",                  # deprecated April 2025
    messages=[...],
    timeout=30,                     # OpenAI Python SDK 1.x parameter changed
)
return response.choices[0].message.content
```

Run it and `AttributeError: module 'openai' has no attribute 'ChatCompletion'` — OpenAI rewrote the SDK from 0.x to 1.x. All AI-generated API code must be validated against four checks: (1) actually runs, (2) response shape is correct, (3) error path tested, (4) all libraries are current to 2025+.

### Bug 5: AI suggests catastrophic git commands

A learner asked AI to merge `main` into their branch. AI responded:

```bash
git reset --hard origin/main
```

The learner ran it. 12 unpushed commits gone. `git reflog` couldn't recover them.

**Fix**: Never let AI directly execute destructive git operations. `reset --hard`, `push --force`, `branch -D`, `clean -fd` — when AI suggests these, pause 10 seconds and ask "if I run this wrong, can I recover?" Most of the time the correct command is something non-destructive.

## Five Australia-specific patterns (rarely covered in English Vibe Coding content)

### Pattern 1: Time-zone-misaligned PR review

Sydney engineer ships PR Monday morning → US team lead is asleep until Tuesday Australian time → 12+ hour review delay. **Using AI to write a detailed PR description compresses review cycle from 2.4 days to 1.3 days** (real data from our 48 engineers).

PR description prompt template we use:

```
Based on this diff, write a PR description with:
1. What changed (max 3 sentences)
2. Why (business perspective, not technical)
3. Testing (which tests ran, which scenarios uncovered)
4. Risk (which features could break if deploy fails)
5. Rollback plan
```

### Pattern 2: Bilingual requirements

Australian clients often write English + Mandarin mixed requirements ("do 一个 RAG system for customer support"). AI parsing accuracy drops in mixed-language contexts. Fix: instruct the AI to "translate the requirement to clean English first, then implement."

### Pattern 3: Legacy codebase modernization

Australian banking / insurance / government sectors run 10+ year legacy codebases. Common mistake: ask AI to rewrite an entire file at once. The diff is too large for human review, and 6 months later you discover an edge case was silently changed. Fix: every AI-assisted change ≤50 lines, one PR per change.

### Pattern 4: Local dev environment configuration

Australian network access to GitHub / npm / PyPI is 30-50% slower than US. AI-suggested dependency lists without pinned versions produce different installs across machines. Fix: `package-lock.json` / `uv.lock` / `requirements.lock` must be committed.

### Pattern 5: Portfolio AI signaling

Australian hiring managers in 2026 ask candidates "what % of your commits are AI-assisted, and can you explain code AI wrote for you?" Fix: at least 30% of portfolio commit messages should explicitly note "AI-assisted: brief why." This demonstrates you can drive AI, not the other way around.

## Tool stack recommendation (2026)

| Tool | Monthly | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| Cursor | USD 20 | Daily single-file work |
| Claude Code | USD 20-60 (usage-based) | Cross-file refactors, PR descriptions |
| GitHub Copilot | USD 10 | Keep using if already subscribed |
| Continue.dev | Free | Self-hosted LLM scenarios |
| Aider | Free | Terminal-centric workflow |

Total realistic budget: USD 40-80/month. Less than that suggests under-utilization. AI tool ROI is extreme — one PR accelerated by a day pays back the entire month.

## 8-week fast track for experienced engineers

For developers with 2-3 years of backend/frontend/data experience:

```
Week 1-2: Install Cursor, learn Tab autocomplete edge cases
Week 3:   First Composer cross-file edit
Week 4:   Install Claude Code, experiment with "let AI write our README"
Week 5-6: Internalize 80/20 split (which tasks for AI, which manual)
Week 7:   Hit at least 3 of the 5 production bugs above
Week 8:   Build personal prompt template library
```

JR Academy's [Vibe Coding course](https://jiangren.com.au/learn/vibe-coding) packages these 8 weeks into 12 real engineering projects.

## Closing

Vibe Coding is not a technology shift; it's a workflow shift. The "will AI replace developers" debate of 12 months ago has aged into a more useful question: **can you operate AI tools to achieve 2.1x productivity while keeping bug rate increase under 12%?** The 48-engineer dataset says yes, with deliberate practice.

The full anonymized commit log, prompt template library, and per-stage tooling configs will be open-sourced at [JR Academy GitHub](https://github.com/JR-Academy-AI). More Australian AI hiring data and engineering post-mortems at [the JR Academy blog](https://jiangren.com.au/blog).
