# Claude Code Hooks in Production: 12 Configs, 48 Engineers, 6 Months of Real Data

If you're using Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI, GA May 2025) without hooks, you're leaving 60% of the value on the table.

Hooks are event-driven shell commands defined in `.claude/settings.json` that fire at specific points in the AI workflow: `pre-bash`, `post-edit`, `pre-commit`, `on-stop`, and others. Configured well, they guarantee that every AI action goes through your team's guardrails — no one commits unformatted code, no one runs `git reset --hard` without confirmation, no one accidentally hardcodes an API key.

This post is the production retrospective from JR Academy's curriculum team. We're an Australian project-based AI engineering bootcamp (P3 model: Project + Production + Placement). 48 engineers across 4 cohorts configured these hooks over 6 months on real projects. The numbers below are anonymized.

## The TL;DR

Five hooks are mandatory:

| Hook | What it prevents | Triggered (6mo / 48 students) |
|---|---|---|
| `pre-commit` secret detection | Hardcoded API keys hitting GitHub | 17 times |
| `pre-bash` destructive command | `git reset --hard` and friends | 34 times |
| `pre-tool-use` sensitive file | AI reading `.env` files | 8 times |
| `post-edit` auto-format | Manual prettier/ruff runs | 2,400 times |
| `post-edit` type-check | Late-found type errors | 890 times |

The first three are anti-disaster (low frequency, high severity). The last two are quality-of-life (high frequency, save real time).

## What Claude Code Hooks are (and aren't)

**Are**: shell commands that fire at specific AI workflow events
**Aren't**:
- Not the AI's prompt (don't change "what the AI thinks")
- Not git hooks (more granular — every AI action can trigger them)
- Not IDE extensions (CLI-native, IDE-agnostic)

Structure of `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "on-start": [],      // session begin
    "post-edit": [],     // after file edits
    "pre-bash": [],      // before bash commands
    "pre-tool-use": [],  // before any tool call
    "pre-commit": [],
    "post-commit": [],
    "on-stop": []        // session end
  }
}
```

Each hook is a shell command. Its stdout/stderr is visible to Claude Code. `exit 1` blocks the action.

---

## The five mandatory hooks

### 1. Secret detection (pre-commit)

```json
{
  "match": ".",
  "command": "git diff --cached | grep -E '(api[_-]?key|password|secret|aws_access)' && { echo '🚨 SECRET'; exit 1; } || true"
}
```

A real incident from our cohort: AI generated `client = OpenAI(api_key="sk-proj-1iE...")` with the key hardcoded. Student ran `git add . && git commit`. The pre-commit hook blocked immediately:

```
🚨 SECRET DETECTED in staged diff
```

This single hook saved a GitHub Security Lab key revocation and ~USD 80 in stolen API spend.

### 2. Destructive command guard (pre-bash)

```json
{
  "match": "(rm -rf|git reset --hard|git push --force|git branch -D|drop database)",
  "command": "echo '⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE: y/n'; read c; [[ $c == 'y' ]] || exit 1"
}
```

A real incident: student asked AI to "merge main into my branch". AI returned `git reset --hard origin/main`. The hook prompted for confirmation. Student typed `n`. **12 unpushed commits saved.**

### 3. Sensitive file access (pre-tool-use)

```json
{
  "match": "Read|Edit|Write",
  "command": "if echo '${args}' | grep -qE '\\.(env|secrets/|credentials)'; then echo '🚨 BLOCKED'; exit 1; fi"
}
```

Prevents AI from reading `.env` files and shipping production secrets to the Anthropic API. (Anthropic doesn't retain prompt content, but for compliance this should still never happen.)

### 4. Auto-format on edit (post-edit)

```json
{
  "match": "\\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$",
  "command": "prettier --write ${file} 2>/dev/null || true"
}
```

Every file the AI edits gets formatted immediately. Saves the manual reformat step before commit. 2,400 invocations across our cohort in 6 months — high frequency, low individual value, large cumulative savings.

### 5. Type-check on edit (post-edit)

```json
{
  "match": "\\.(ts|tsx)$",
  "command": "npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck 2>&1 | head -20"
}
```

Type errors surface in the AI's context immediately so it can fix them. Beats catching them at commit time by 10x in turnaround speed.

## The complete copy-paste settings.json

Drop this into `.claude/settings.json` (project-level, commit to repo for team) or `~/.claude/settings.json` (personal global):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schemastore.org/claude-settings.json",
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Bash(npm run *)", "Bash(uv run *)", "Bash(pytest *)", "Bash(git status)", "Bash(git diff *)"]
  },
  "hooks": {
    "on-start": [
      { "command": "[ -f .claude/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md ] && cat .claude/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md" }
    ],
    "post-edit": [
      { "match": "\\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$", "command": "prettier --write ${file} 2>/dev/null || true" },
      { "match": "\\.py$", "command": "ruff format ${file} 2>/dev/null || true; uv run mypy ${file} 2>&1 | head -10 || true" },
      { "match": "\\.go$", "command": "gofmt -w ${file} && go vet ./... 2>&1 | head -10" }
    ],
    "pre-bash": [
      { "match": "(rm -rf|git reset --hard|git push --force|git branch -D)",
        "command": "echo '⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE: y/n'; read c; [[ $c == 'y' ]] || exit 1" }
    ],
    "pre-tool-use": [
      { "match": "Read|Edit|Write",
        "command": "if echo '${args}' | grep -qE '\\.(env|secrets/|credentials)'; then echo '🚨 BLOCKED'; exit 1; fi" }
    ],
    "pre-commit": [
      { "match": ".", "command": "git diff --cached | grep -E '(api[_-]?key|password|secret_key|aws_access)' && { echo '🚨 SECRET'; exit 1; } || true" },
      { "match": ".", "command": "git diff --cached --name-only | xargs grep -l -E '(console\\.(log|debug)|^\\s*print\\()' 2>/dev/null | head -5 && { echo '⚠️ debug left in'; exit 1; } || true" }
    ],
    "post-commit": [
      { "command": "BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD); git push origin $BRANCH:backup/${BRANCH} 2>/dev/null || true" }
    ],
    "on-stop": [
      { "command": "echo '\\n📋 Session self-check: tests / CHANGELOG / PR description'" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Why this matters for hiring

From our analysis of 312 Australian AI Engineer JDs (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026):

```
"Claude Code / hooks / Cursor Rules experience" frequency:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Junior (base < 100k):    < 8%
Mid (base 130-160k):     ~22%
Senior+ (base ≥ 170k):   35%
```

Knowing how to use AI to write code is junior table-stakes. **Engineering the guardrails around AI workflow** — hooks, Cursor Rules, custom validation — is the Junior → Mid signal. Correlates with AUD 20-30k/year salary delta in the Australian market.

If you're a hiring manager screening AI engineers in 2026: ask candidates to walk through their `.claude/settings.json`. Empty file = junior. Five+ thoughtful hooks = mid-level production discipline.

## A 6-week rollout for teams

```
Week 1: Install the 5 mandatory hooks on every engineer's machine
Week 2: Run for one week, collect false-positive reports, tune match patterns
Week 3: Add pre-commit unit test + post-commit backup-branch push
Week 4: Roll out to all 5+ team engineers
Week 5: Add project-specific hooks (i18n key validation, migration checks, etc.)
Week 6: Commit .claude/settings.json to repo; new hires inherit automatically
```

## When NOT to use hooks

- One-off scripts / throwaway projects — overhead not worth it
- Pure IDE workflow (no Claude Code CLI usage) — hooks don't fire
- Hooks that block AI in 30%+ of legitimate actions — re-tune match patterns or remove

---

## Closing

Hooks are the production guardrail for AI workflow in 2026. With them in place, you sleep better knowing the AI can't ship hardcoded secrets, can't run `git reset --hard` without your approval, and can't accidentally read sensitive files.
