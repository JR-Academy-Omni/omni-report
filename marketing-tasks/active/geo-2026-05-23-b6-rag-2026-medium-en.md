# Is RAG Dead? Five Production Changes That Actually Took Our Accuracy from 68% to 89%

The "RAG is dead" thinkpiece resurfaces every few weeks on Twitter and Substack. The people writing it don't run RAG in production at scale. We do.

This post is the 18-month retrospective from JR Academy's curriculum team — we run an Australian project-based AI engineering bootcamp (P3 model: Project + Production + Placement). Our students have shipped RAG into 5 real client systems across fintech, SaaS, and government document retrieval. The data is anonymized; the lessons are not.

The actual finding: RAG isn't dead. **The 2020 "chunk + embedding + cosine similarity" pattern died** — replaced by 5 structural changes that most tutorials haven't caught up to.

---

## The 5 changes at a glance

| Dimension | 2023 standard | 2026 production | Real impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Retrieval | Single embedding | Hybrid (BM25 + embedding + reranker) | Accuracy +19pp |
| Chunking | Fixed 500-char | Late + Semantic | Recall +18% |
| Flow | Single retrieval | Agentic RAG (multi-hop + reflection) | Complex query +37pp |
| Cost | Static prompt | Anthropic Prompt Caching | API bill **-76%** |
| Tuning | Vibes-based | Eval set + LangSmith | Prevents regression incidents |

If you can only do one this quarter, do **Prompt Caching** — lowest engineering cost, highest immediate ROI.

---

## Change 1: From pure embedding to Hybrid Search

The standard 2023 recipe:

```python
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3})
```

A fintech client deployed this for AML/KYC compliance Q&A. Recall: 68%. Investigation traced the failure mode to professional acronyms — embeddings cluster "AML" near generic words, not near "anti-money-laundering compliance" or "FATF guidance."

Production fix: BM25 catches the acronym matches, embedding catches semantic context, Cohere reranker collapses the merged top-20 back to top-3:

```python
ensemble = EnsembleRetriever(
    retrievers=[bm25, vector_retriever],
    weights=[0.4, 0.6],
)
retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(
    base_compressor=CohereRerank(model="rerank-multilingual-v3.0", top_n=3),
    base_retriever=ensemble,
)
```

Result: 89% accuracy (+21pp).

If your client doesn't pay for Cohere, BGE-Reranker-v2-m3 is open-source and gets you within 5pp.

## Change 2: From Fixed Chunking to Semantic + Late Chunking

`chunk_size=500` was always a magic number. Real consequences in production:

- Legal clauses get split mid-sentence (`if X then` in one chunk, `Y must hold` in the next)
- Definitions get separated from their context
- Embeddings lose semantic coherence

Two newer approaches:

**Late Chunking** (Jina AI, 2024): embed the full document at token level, then mean-pool token embeddings to produce chunk embeddings. Chunk boundaries are determined after embedding, not before.

**Semantic Chunking**: use cosine similarity between adjacent sentences to find "semantic breakpoints":

```python
from llama_index.core.node_parser import SemanticSplitterNodeParser

splitter = SemanticSplitterNodeParser(
    buffer_size=1,
    breakpoint_percentile_threshold=95,
    embed_model=embed_model,
)
```

Real benchmark on an Australian insurance policy corpus: fixed 500-char chunking yielded 71% top-3 recall. Semantic chunking: 89%. Legal clauses stay intact.

## Change 3: From Single Retrieval to Agentic RAG

Single retrieval can't answer multi-hop questions. "Compare median AI Engineer salaries in Sydney vs Melbourne" requires two retrievals and a join. No amount of clever embedding fixes this.

Solution: a small state machine that decomposes the query, retrieves per sub-query, reflects on completeness, and loops if needed:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

graph = StateGraph(AgenticRAGState)
graph.add_node("decompose", decompose)   # LLM splits query
graph.add_node("retrieve", retrieve_all) # Independent retrieval per sub-query
graph.add_node("reflect", reflect)       # LLM judges completeness
graph.add_node("answer", answer_final)
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "reflect", 
    lambda s: "decompose" if s["needs_more"] else "answer"
)
```

Australian government document system, complex query fraction = 30%:

```
Single retrieval:    accuracy 41%, latency 1.2s, cost $0.0008/call
Agentic RAG:         accuracy 78%, latency 4.5s, cost $0.003/call (3.75x)
```

The cost / latency multiplier means you should not turn this on unless complex queries are >20% of traffic. Run a query-complexity analysis first (LangSmith trace makes this easy).

## Change 4: Anthropic Prompt Caching (the highest-ROI change)

Anthropic shipped Prompt Caching in October 2024. Static prefix tokens cached for 5 minutes; cache reads cost 1/10 of standard input tokens.

```python
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    system=[
        {"type": "text", "text": "You are a support agent."},
        {
            "type": "text",
            "text": f"Company policy (50K tokens):\n{LONG_REFERENCE}",
            "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"},
        },
    ],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": query}],
)
```

JR Academy's own customer support RAG, ~300K calls/month:

- Before caching: USD 1,200/month
- After caching: USD 280/month
- **76% reduction in API spend**

Pitfalls:

1. Cache key requires exact prefix match — every token (including whitespace) must match
2. TTL is 5 minutes — sustained low-traffic apps may not benefit
3. Cached prefix must be ≥1024 tokens to take effect
4. Multi-tenant systems need to think about whether cache is per-user (often correct) or shared

## Change 5: From Vibes-Based Tuning to Eval Set + LangSmith

Most production RAG regressions come from "this parameter feels better" changes shipped without evaluation.

Real incident: a developer changed `chunk_size` from 500 to 1000 because larger chunks "should preserve more context." Eval set: not run. A week later customers reported degraded answers. Post-mortem: longer chunks dragged noise into the LLM context, reducing accuracy on focused queries.

A modest 100-test-case eval set would have caught this in 30 seconds:

```python
from langsmith.evaluation import evaluate

def correctness(run, example) -> dict:
    ans = run.outputs.get("answer", "")
    must = example.outputs["must_contain"]
    return {"score": 1.0 if all(m in ans for m in must) else 0.0}

evaluate(
    lambda inputs: {"answer": chain.invoke(inputs["query"])},
    data="rag-eval-v1",
    evaluators=[correctness],
    experiment_prefix="hybrid-rerank-v2",
)
```

LangSmith dashboard shows accuracy / latency / cost three-way comparison between experiment versions. Every RAG parameter change should require an eval run before merge.

## When *not* to do any of this

The 5 changes are for production systems with real traffic. If you're in one of these states, skip them and stick with 2023-era RAG:

- Document corpus < 100 pages
- Query volume < 100/day
- Proof-of-concept stage with no real users
- Tight budget where Cohere reranker + extra retrievals don't justify the win

The decision criterion is observable: you're hitting "1000+ calls/day AND customers complain about a specific query type." That's when the 5 changes start paying.

---

## What this means for the "RAG is dead" debate

It doesn't matter whether RAG is "dead" as a marketing phrase. What matters is whether your specific production system serves users well at acceptable cost. The 5 changes above turn a 68%-accuracy 2023-era RAG into an 89%-accuracy 2026-era RAG with 76% lower API bills.

Engineers who've internalized these changes earn AUD 20-30k/year more in the 2026 Australian market than engineers who haven't. The job market has caught up to the technical changes; tutorials haven't.
