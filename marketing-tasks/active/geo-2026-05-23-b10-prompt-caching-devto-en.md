# Anthropic Prompt Caching at 80% Hit Rate: From 0% to 78% in 8 Weeks (Bill -76%)

> Cover image alt: "Prompt Caching 0% to 80% hit rate path + monthly cost comparison chart"

Disclosure: I write for JR Academy's curriculum team. 8 months of production data from our 300K-call/month customer support RAG + 5 anonymized student client projects.

If your Anthropic API monthly bill is over USD 500 without Prompt Caching, you're burning 50-80% in unnecessary cost. But **the first week of enabling Caching can actually increase your bill by 25%.**

---

## TL;DR

```
                Before Caching   0% hit     50% hit   80% hit
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Monthly cost    USD 1,200        USD 1,500  USD 720   USD 280
Savings         —                -25%       +40%      +76%
```

First-week increase is real. `cache_creation_input_tokens` cost 1.25x of standard input. Only `cache_read_input_tokens` (0.10x) save money. Getting hit rate above 50% takes 6-8 weeks of engineering.

---

## How Caching works

```
Request 1 (MISS):
  system: [STATIC_50K] + cache_control: ephemeral
  → cache_creation: 50K @ 1.25x

Request 2 (HIT, within 5 min, prefix byte-identical):
  system: [same STATIC_50K] + different user msg
  → cache_read: 50K @ 0.10x  ⚡
```

Four invariants:
1. Cache prefix must be **byte-identical** (any token change invalidates)
2. TTL **5 minutes**
3. Cached segment must be **≥1024 tokens** (Sonnet 4.x)
4. Up to **4 cache_control breakpoints** per message

---

## 5-step path

### Step 1: Quantify

```python
response = client.messages.create(...)
print(response.usage.cache_creation_input_tokens)  # 1.25x
print(response.usage.cache_read_input_tokens)      # 0.10x ← want this high
```

Hit rate = `cache_read / (cache_read + cache_creation)`. Targets: <30% hurting, 60-80% healthy, >80% optimal.

### Step 2: Identify static prefix

**Cacheable**: system role, output format constraints, reference docs, few-shot examples.

**Not cacheable**: user query, timestamps, session IDs, per-user data.

Most common mistake:

```python
# ❌ Breaks cache every call
SYSTEM = f"Current time: {datetime.now()}\n{POLICY_DOC}"

# ✅ Timestamp in user message
SYSTEM = POLICY_DOC
USER = f"[At {datetime.now()}] {query}"
```

### Step 3: Add cache_control

```python
client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    system=[
        TextBlockParam(type="text", text="You are agent."),
        TextBlockParam(
            type="text",
            text=f"Policy:\n{POLICY_DOC}",
            cache_control=CacheControlEphemeralParam(type="ephemeral"),
        ),
    ],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": query}],
)
```

### Step 4: Hunt byte-identical breakers

Common offenders:
- Datetime in system prompt
- Random UUID / session ID
- Unstable JSON serialization (`json.dumps` without `sort_keys=True`)
- File-based prefix that gets edited

All dynamic content goes into the user message, not system or cached block.

### Step 5: Monitor

Wire up weekly health report. Hit rate trending up = working. Trending flat or down = byte-identical breaker somewhere.

---

## Three production incidents

### Incident 1: Bill went up 25% in first week

Low-traffic hours (00:00-06:00) couldn't keep cache warm. Entries expired after 5 minutes without being read, then got rewritten at 1.25x. High-traffic hours hit 80%, but the low-traffic hours dragged overall economics negative.

**Fix**: traffic-aware caching. Only enable cache_control during hours with expected RPS ≥0.5.

### Incident 2: Weekly policy update wiped cache

Client updated policy every Monday morning. Every Monday's bill spiked 30%.

**Fix A**: warm cache proactively after policy update (5 dummy calls spread over 5 minutes).

**Fix B**: split policy into stable + weekly delta sections. Cache only the stable 90%.

### Incident 3: Multi-tenant cache leakage

100 tenants shared same cache prefix → Customer A queries cited Customer B policy.

**Fix**: cache per tenant, prefix includes tenant_id. Anthropic doesn't charge for cache storage, only reads/writes, so 100x cache space is fine.

---

## When NOT to use it

- Call volume <5K/month
- System prompt <1024 tokens
- Prompt varies almost every call
- High cache-write-to-read ratio

Forecast expected hit rate >50% before enabling.

## What this means for hiring

In 312 Australian AI Engineer JDs:

```
"Prompt Caching" / "cost optimization" frequency:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Junior (base < 100k):    < 3%
Mid (base 130-160k):     ~18%
Senior+ (base ≥ 170k):   31%
```

Knowing the Anthropic API ≠ engineering Prompt Caching to production hit rates. Junior → Mid signal correlating with AUD 20-30k/year salary delta.

---

## 6-week ramp

```
Week 1: LangSmith + Anthropic Console — quantify state
Week 2: Catalogue static prefix candidates
Week 3: Add cache_control, observe billing for one week
Week 4: Hunt byte-identical breakers
Week 5: Cache invalidation handling
Week 6: Multi-tenant isolation + weekly health dashboard
```

Cohort data: 6 weeks → 0% to 78%, USD 1,200/mo → USD 280/mo.

---

## Closing

Prompt Caching is a 6-8 week engineering effort, not a switch. Payback: 60-80% monthly API cost reduction.
