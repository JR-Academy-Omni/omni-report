# Vibe Coding in Production — 48 Engineers, 12 Months of Cursor + Claude Code Data

> Cover image alt: "Cursor + Claude Code workflow diagram with productivity chart"

Disclosure up front: I write for JR Academy's curriculum team. We're an Australian AI engineering bootcamp, and Cursor + Claude Code became mandatory tooling in our program 12 months ago. This post is the anonymized aggregate data from 48 engineers across 4 cohorts — the productivity gains, the trade-off nobody warns you about, and the 5 production bugs every AI coder eventually hits.

---

## TL;DR

| Metric | Before | After | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Commits/week | 8.3 | 17.6 | **2.1x** ⬆️ |
| Lines/week | 412 | 968 | 2.3x ⬆️ |
| PR review cycle | 2.4 days | 1.3 days | 0.54x ⬇️ |
| Bug rate (per 1000 lines) | 4.2 | 4.7 | **1.12x** ⚠️ |

**Productivity 2.1x, bug rate 1.12x.** The trade-off is real. The productivity gain dwarfs the bug cost if you know how to navigate it. Below is how.

---

## The 80/20 workflow

```
80%  Cursor       Single-file work, Tab completion, prototyping
20%  Claude Code  Cross-file refactor, complex debug, write tests, PR description
```

The most common mistake is using one tool for everything. Cursor is best at single-file Tab acceptance; Claude Code is best at whole-repo context. Mixing them by task type is the workflow.

A typical engineer day:

```
9:30 AM   Cursor — main feature
11:30     Cursor — debug single-file
2:00 PM   → Claude Code — refactor across 3 files
2:30      Review diff, apply manually
3:30      ← Cursor — adjustments
5:00      Claude Code — PR description first draft
5:30      Submit PR
```

Two tool transitions per day on average. Early users switch too much and lose time; experienced users have internalized "single-file vs cross-file" recognition.

---

## The 5 production bugs

### 1. AI hallucinates non-existent functions

```python
from langchain.tools import GoogleSearchRun  # moved to langchain_community.tools mid-2024
```

`Fix`: always `pip show <pkg>` before trusting AI imports. Cursor's Composer reads `requirements.txt` for version-correct imports.

### 2. AI forgets earlier code in large files

1500-line file, AI adds a method at line 1480 using a type imported at line 12, outside its effective context window. Build breaks.

`Fix`: use Claude Code for cross-file/large-file work (full repo context), not Cursor. Or prompt "list all imports first, then write the method."

### 3. AI fix loop makes things worse

Real cycle: button not working → AI fix #1 changes `this` binding (still broken) → AI fix #2 adds `preventDefault` (breaks form) → AI fix #3 hard-codes redirect (breaks router). Original bug partially fixed + 2 regressions.

`Fix`: after AI's second failed attempt, humans take over. `git stash` and debug the real root cause.

### 4. AI writes "looks production-ready" but uses deprecated APIs

```python
openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-4", timeout=30)  # all of this is broken in OpenAI SDK 1.x
```

`Fix`: 4-step validation for all AI-generated API code — runs, response shape correct, error path tested, libraries current to 2025+.

### 5. AI suggests catastrophic git commands

Asked "merge main into my branch", AI replied `git reset --hard origin/main`. Learner ran it. 12 unpushed commits gone.

`Fix`: never let AI directly execute destructive git ops. `reset --hard`, `push --force`, `branch -D`, `clean -fd` — pause 10 seconds and ask "if I run this wrong, can I recover?"

---

## Australia-specific patterns

| Pattern | Fix |
|---|---|
| Time-zone-misaligned PR review (Sydney → US) | Use Claude Code for detailed PR descriptions; review cycle 2.4→1.3 days |
| Bilingual requirements (mixed Mandarin + English) | Prompt: "translate to clean English first, then implement" |
| Legacy banking/insurance codebase | Max 50 lines per AI-assisted change, one PR per change |
| Slow AU network to GitHub/npm | Commit `package-lock.json` / `uv.lock` |
| Portfolio AI signaling for AU recruiters | 30%+ commits with "AI-assisted: brief why" message |

---

## Tool stack 2026

| Tool | Monthly | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Cursor | USD 20 | `keep` — daily single-file |
| Claude Code | USD 20-60 | `keep` — cross-file + PR desc |
| GitHub Copilot | USD 10 | `keep` if already subscribed |
| Continue.dev | free | `keep` for self-hosted LLM |
| Aider | free | `keep` for terminal workflow |
| Codeium | free | `skip` — no unique edge in 2026 |

Realistic budget USD 40-80/month. ROI is extreme: one PR accelerated by a day pays the entire month.

## 8-week fast track for experienced engineers

```
Week 1-2: Cursor, Tab autocomplete edges
Week 3:   First Composer cross-file edit
Week 4:   Claude Code, "let AI write our README"
Week 5-6: Internalize 80/20 split
Week 7:   Hit at least 3 of the 5 production bugs
Week 8:   Build personal prompt template library
```

JR Academy's [Vibe Coding course](https://jiangren.com.au/learn/vibe-coding) packages these 8 weeks into 12 real engineering projects.

## Closing

Vibe Coding isn't a technology shift, it's a workflow shift. The useful question in 2026 is: **can you operate AI tools to achieve 2.1x productivity while keeping bug rate increase under 12%?** Our data says yes, with deliberate practice.

Full anonymized commit log, prompt template library, and per-stage tooling configs are open-sourced at [JR Academy GitHub](https://github.com/JR-Academy-AI). More AU AI hiring data on [the blog](https://jiangren.com.au/blog).
